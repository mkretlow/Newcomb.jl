# Newcomb.jl [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/mkretlow/Newcomb.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/mkretlow/Newcomb.jl)
Julia wrapper to my Fortran (legacy) implementation of *Newcomb's Tables of the Sun*, an analytical representation of the motion of the Earth.

This ephemerides were used in *The Astronomical Almanac*, published by the United States Naval Observatory (USNO) and Her Majesty's Nautical Almanac Office (HMNAO), until 1984 and have been superseded by more accurate numerically-integrated ephemerides developed at Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
